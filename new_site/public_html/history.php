				Our ‘World Famous’ Red Brat was originally made by a local Madison

				butcher named George Bishop. From the early 50’s until the late 60’s, Bishop

				would get the order for the week from the Brathaus owners Seymore “Shorty”

				Kayes or Warren “Lammy” Lamm. George made up the proprietary recipe

				uniquely and exclusively for the Brathaus. The Brats were delivered weekly in old

				shoe boxes, and then were smoked and split by the Brathaus staff in the basement

				of the Brathaus! The current owners of State Street Brats personally smoked and

				cut the brats when they worked there in the late 1970’s while going to college!

				Unfortunately, George Bishop passed away and the recipe was part of

				George’s estate! Shorty and Lammy then purchased the World Famous recipe

				from George’s estate, they commissioned Jefferson Meats (Jefferson, Wisconsin)

				to make the Red Brat during the 1970’s. Over the next 20 years Jefferson Meats

				was eventually acquired by Doskocil, which then was purchased by Wilson

				Continental Deli, which split off the sausage portion of the business to Tyson

				Meats.

				In the late 90’s, State Street Brats was faced with taking the recipe to more

				local source, as their production was not large enough for such a large meat

				company. The new provider became Klements Meat Company located in

				Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Now present day the Red Brat is made by Trig’s Sausage

				Company Located in Rhilander, Wisconsin. (If you have ever been in Rhinelander,

				you know about the quality products they make. Trig’s has been a great partner

				with State Street Brats for many years and will ship the Red Brat to you along with

				any of the other great products they make!

				State Street Brats would like to think as a business they are standing on the

				shoulders of Shorty and Lammy, and their Bratwurst vision of a smoked, split, beef

				bratwurst- which is known as the ‘Red Brat”.

				Side note: It is called the Red Brat due to is unique recipe composition of beef and

				pork, the beef within the brat gives it the red coloring and where the term Red Brat

				originates. Traditional brats are pork based, Sheboygan style (not split) beer

				Bratwurst that you have likely had at your local tailgate. State Street Brats calls

				these brats White Brats. The Brathaus never served the White Brats in all its years

				of operation! In 1989, when the Brathaus became State Street Brats the White Brat

				was added to the menu along with a number of other menu items!
