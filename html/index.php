	 	Whether you're celebrating a special occasion or just going out for the night, we want to host your group! Submit this form with your group's information and we will get back to you with personalized specials just for your group. All party sizes welcome (The larger the group, the better the discount).
	 	<br/><br/>
		We love themed events and may offer special deals to such a group. Come in with your sports jerseys, ugly sweaters, etc... Include your theme in the box provided for your custom tailored deal!
		<br/><br/>
		Upon arrival, you and your guests will get wristbands and access to your personalized specials. Your party may be private - your group alone on the 2nd floor (which will require a room fee) or open to the public.
		<br/><br/>
		If you prefer, you may also have a semi-private event in our new second floor party room. This upstairs room can accommodate up to 30 people and can also host keg or bottle service style events. This is great for birthday parties, Bachelor(-ette) parties, or any other night out.  Please inquire using the form below for all special access needs, as all our party rooms are on the SECOND FLOOR of the business.
		<br/><br/>
		We have several room size options!  Our brand new second floor VIP ROOM is available for smaller events; it seats up to 30 people.  Depending on your needs, we can provide waitstaff to serve your entourage. This type of party would require a setting a minimum bartab, call us for details! 
		<br/><br/>
		If your group is larger, you can book the entire second floor exlusively for a room reservation fee.  Contact us to hear about special rebates we offer for arriving with your entire crew!  As of February 2013, we are unable to host private late night (after 9pm) events on our second floor on Tuesday, Friday, or Saturday nights, but we would love to have your group on any other night of the week!
		<br/><br/>
		We offer a variety of options for both food and beverage.  Whether you're interested in light appetizers, brats and burgers galore, or anything in between, we aim to please!
