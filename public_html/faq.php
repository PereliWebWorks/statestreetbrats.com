		<div class="question">
	 	Q: What is the difference between a White Brat and a Red Brat?
	 	</div>
	 	<div class="answer">
		A: If you've ever had a delicious brat before, you've probably had a white brat. The WHITE BRAT is a traditional pork brat, soaked in beer and onions before being grilled to perfection. The RED BRAT is our specialty that you can only get here. It is a mixture of pork and beef that  is smoked and then butterfly cut. It is particularly tasty with cheddar cheese melted on top!  Both of these tasty brats are made for us by Trig's Smokehouse in Rhinelander, Wisconsin.
